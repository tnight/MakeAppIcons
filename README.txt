1. About this software
----
Using a sample image, this software creates application (app) icons in
all the standard pixel sizes used by iOS.

NOTE: This software requires the Image Magick software package to be
installed and available in the command path.


2. Usage
----
MakeAppIcons.pl <input-image-name.xxx> <output-image-prefix>

Input image must be at least 180x180 pixels in size and must be
square (same pixel height and width). Output files will have names like:

<output-image-prefix> NNNpx.xxx

where NNN is the pixel size, and ".xxx" is the file name extension.

An example command line usage would be:

shell> MakeAppIcons.pl my-spoon-and-fork.png Food\ Tracker
